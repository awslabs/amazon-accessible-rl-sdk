"""Allow notebooks to import custom modules at a few pre-defined places within this project's
git repository.

When imported, adds ``GITROOT``, ``GITROOT/src``, and ``GITROOT/notebooks`` to `sys.path`.

Place this file in the same directory as your ``.ipynb`` files. If ``.ipynb`` files are organized
into subfolders, please ensure this file is presented in each subfolder. Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    GITROOT
    |-- .git                   # Signify this is a git repository
    |-- notebooks              # Parent folder of Jupyter notebooks
    |   |-- folder-a
    |   |   |-- my_nb_path.py  # Importable by nb-abc.ipynb and nb-xyz.ipynb
    |   |   |-- nb-abc.ipynb
    |   |   `-- nb-xyz.ipynb
    |   |-- my_nb_path.py      # Importable by nb-01.ipynb and nb-02.ipynb
    |   |-- nb-01.ipynb
    |   `-- nb-02.ipynb
    `-- src
        `-- my_custom_module
            |-- __init__.py
            `-- ...

Usage by ``.ipynb``:

    >>> # Allow this notebook to import from GITROOT, GITROOT/src, and GITROOT/notebooks.
    >>> # This module must be imported before importing any other custom modules under GITROOT.
    >>> # The isort directive prevents the statement to be moved around when isort is used.
    >>> import my_nb_path  # isort: skip
    >>>
    >>> # Test-drive importing a custom module under GITROOT/src.
    >>> import my_custom_module

Background: we used to rely on ``ipython_config.py`` in the current working directory. However,
IPython 8.0.1+, 7.31.1+ and 5.11+ disable this behavior for security reason as described
[here](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version8.html#ipython-8-0-1-cve-2022-21699).

So now, each ``.ipynb`` must explicitly modify its own `sys.path` which is what this module offers
as convenience.
